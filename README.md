## Sunwake

Sunwake is a project created to replace traditional alarm clocks. It and its counterpart component Noisewake are intended to slowly increase the presence of light and white noise (and rain sounds if it's actually raining in your location) within a space to imitate a sunrise, providing for a much more natural and pleasant waking up in the morning.

I created it to replace my alarm clock in an attempt to improve upon my overall happiness, health, and energy levels throughout the day.

## In its current state, it's definitely a tinkerer's project, with only the basic working functionality within the code. There's no GUI for the Noisewake script or outside control with the Arduino code.
